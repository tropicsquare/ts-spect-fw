SPECT provides several operations for CPU that the CPU uses to perform more complex tasks, e. g. execute \LLLCMD{}s.

SPECT comes with two types of firmware:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Boot FW} -- small firmware to support boot-up sequence of the chip.
    \item \textbf{Application FW} -- firmware that is preloaded into SPECTs instruction memory during
                                     boot-up sequence and used in final application. 
\end{itemize}

\TropicNote{
    Besides these, another set of SPECT operations is available for debug purposes. These operations do not rely on
    functionality of SCB, CPB nor KBUS.
}
\hspace{.3cm}

CPU specifies SPECT operation and SPECT firmware parameters by writing\linebreak
\Register{SPECT_CFG_WORD} on address 0x0100 of SPECTs address space (Data RAM In).

\vspace{.3cm}
\Register{SPECT_CFG_WORD}:

\begin{TropicRatioTable3Col}
    {0.5}                                 {0.25}                          {0.25}
    {[31:16]                            & [15:8]                        & [7:0]                  }
    \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_IN_SIZE}    & \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC}    & \Register{SPECT_OP_ID} \Ttlb
\end{TropicRatioTable3Col}
\hspace{.3cm}

CPU selects input data source via \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC[7:4]}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC[7:4]}=0x0 -- SPECT operation takes input data from its Data RAM In.
    \item \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC[7:4]}=0x4 -- SPECT operation takes input data from Command Buffer.
\end{itemize}

CPU selects output data destination via \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC[3:0]}.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC[3:0]}=0x1 -- SPECT operation stores output data to its Data RAM Out.
    \item \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC[3:0]}=0x5 -- SPECT operation stores output data to Result Buffer.
\end{itemize}

CPU indicates number of bytes in Command Buffer or Data RAM In via \linebreak
\Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_IN_SIZE} field.

After SPECT finishes current operation, CPU reads \Register{SPECT_RES_WORD} from address \linebreak
0x1100 in SPECTs address space (Data RAM Out).

\vspace{.3cm}
\Register{SPECT_RES_WORD:}

\begin{TropicRatioTable3Col}
    {0.5}                                 {0.25}    {0.25}
    {[31:16]                            & [15:8]  & [7:0]                  }
    \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_OUT_SIZE}   & --      & \Register{SPECT_OP_STATUS} \Ttlb
\end{TropicRatioTable3Col}
\hspace{.3cm}

SPECT indicates status of the executed operation via \Register{SPECT_OP_STATUS}. SPECT also
indicates number of bytes in Data RAM Out or Result Buffer via \linebreak \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_OUT_SIZE}.

\TropicNote{
    When SPECT executes operation that corresponds to one whole \LLLCMD{} (\LLLCMD{} is not
    split into multiple SPECT operations), then \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_IN_SIZE} = \TsApiCmdFld{CMD_SIZE}
    and \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_OUT_SIZE} = \TsApiCmdFld{RES_SIZE}.
}

\vspace{.3cm}
Values of \Register{SPECT_OP_STATUS} after SPECT operation execution can be following:

\hspace{.3cm}
\begin{TropicRatioTable2Col}
    {0.2}       {0.8}
    {Value      & Description}
    0x00        & SPECT Operation executed successfully     \Ttlb
    0xF1        & SPECT Context error                       \Ttlb
    0xF2        & SPECT KBUS error                          \Ttlb
    0xF3        & SPECT Invalid OP_ID error                 \Ttlb

    0x41        & Point Integrity Error                     \Ttlb
\end{TropicRatioTable2Col}
\hspace{.3cm}

To perform some more complex algorithm, such as EdDSA or secure channel establishment,
CPU needs to invoke SPECT multiple times. In such a case, SPECT keeps context between
execution of each partial operation.

SPECT Context is a set of values (e.g. keys or context of TMAC), that SPECT keeps inside
and uses them during its next operations. CPU shall invoke only such SPECT operation,
which input context matches the output context (or part of it) of previously invoked
SPECT operation. Otherwise the context would be corrupted or the result of such SPECT
operation undefined.

SPECT is capable of processing these \LLLCMD{}s by it self:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \TsApiCmd{ECC_Key_Generate} -- ecc_key_generate SPECT Op
    \item \TsApiCmd{ECC_Key_Store} -- ecc_key_store SPECT Op
    \item \TsApiCmd{ECC_Key_Read} -- ecc_key_read SPECT Op
    \item \TsApiCmd{ECC_Key_Erase} -- ecc_key_erase SPECT Op
    \item \TsApiCmd{ECDSA_Sign} -- ecdsa_sign SPECT Op
\end{itemize}

\TropicNote{
    \Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC} is used for debug purpose, when unencrypted \LLLCMD{} is send to the device.
    That allows the CPU to bypass SCB and CPB and load the content of the \LLLCMD{} directly to SPECTs Data RAM In.
    In final implementation, no such bypass shall be possible.

\subsubsection*{SHA512 example:}

Let \textbf{M} be a 326 byte data (\texttt{u8 M [326]}). SHA512(\textbf{M}) is computed as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Pad the data with SHA512 padding to multiple of 128B, see \ref{fig.sha512_padding}.
    \item Initialize SPECTs SHA512 unit with \textbf{sha512_init()}.
    \item Process first chunk with \textbf{sha512_update(M[0:127])}.
    \item Process second chunk with \textbf{sha512_update(M[128:255])}.
    \item Process the rest of \textbf{M} with \textbf{sha512_final(M[256:383])}.
    \item Data RAM Out now contains the SHA512 digest of \textbf{M}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Processing \LLLCMD{} using SPECT}

CPU always issues first 16 byte chunk of \LLLCMD{} to SCB. SCB decrypts the chunk and passes
it to CPB. CPB checks user access privileges and stores the \Register{CMD_} \LLLCMD{} for SPECT into Command
Buffer. After first 16 byte chunk, CPU reads \TsApiCmd{CMD_ID} from CPB.
If \TsApiCmd{CMD_ID} corresponds to Commands to be executed by SPECT, CPU
invokes according SPECT operation.

CPU always issues first 16 byte chunk of \LLLCMD{}s \Register{CMD_CIPHERTEXT} to SCB. SCB decrypts the chunk and passes
it to CPB. CPB checks user access privileges and stores the decrypted \Register{CMD_CIPHERTEXT} into
Command Buffer. Then CPU reads the \LLLCMD{}s \TsApiCmdFld{CMD_ID} from CPB. Following three cases may occur:

\subsubsection*{\TsApiCmdFld{CMD_ID} corresponds to one of \TsApiCmd{ECC_Key_*}}

In this case, CPU issues the rest of \Register{CMD_CIPHERTEXT} to SCB. After that, Command Buffer contains all data
and information needed for executing the corresponding \linebreak SPECT operation. CPU sets
\Register{SPECT_INOUT_SRC}=0x54 and invokes SPECT.

SPECT reads Command Buffer and performs the corresponding SPECT operation. Then it stores all output
data for the \LLLCMD{} to Result Buffer, sets \linebreak \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_OUT_SIZE} to number of bytes
it has stored and notifies CPU.

CPU reads \Register{SPECT_OP_DATA_OUT_SIZE} bytes from Result Buffer, that are encrypted by SCB resulting
in \Register{RES_CIPHERTEXT} of the \LLLRES{}.

\subsubsection*{\TsApiCmdFld{CMD_ID} corresponds to \TsApiCmd{ECDSA_Sign}}

In this case, the process is almost the same as in the case of \TsApiCmd{ECC_Key_*}. In addition, CPU reads
the Secure Channel Nonce and Secure Channel Hash from SCB and loads it in to SPECTs Data RAM In before
invoking SPECT.

\subsubsection*{\TsApiCmdFld{CMD_ID} corresponds to \TsApiCmd{EDDSA_Sign}}

In this case, the \LLLCMD{} has arbitrary length, depending on the length of the \TsApiCmdFld{MSG} field.
Therefore the \TsApiCmd{EDDSA_Sign} \LLLCMD{} is processed with a sequence of SPECT operations from
\ref{sec:spect_op:eddsa}. We can divide this sequence into 5 phases:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Setting context and loading keys -- eddsa_set_context / eddsa_set_context_dbg
    \item Computing nonce $r$ using TMAC -- eddsa_nonce_*
    \item Computing signature part \TsApiCmdFld{R} -- eddsa_R_part
    \item Computing e = SHA512(\TsApiCmdFld{R}, A, \TsApiCmdFld{MSG}) -- eddsa_e_*
    \item Computing signature part \TsApiCmdFld{S} -- eddsa_finish
\end{enumerate}

Figures \ref{EdDSA_DF} shows the sequence in a detail.
